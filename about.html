            Behind IT Insights is Gabriel Fares, a junior majoring in BS IT, with a strong passion for exploring everything IT-related.

            Outside of academics, I enjoy going to the gym and reading, which helps me maintain a balanced perspective. This passion for technology and continuous learning ensures that IT Insights remains a trustworthy source for both seasoned professionals and newcomers in the tech world.
