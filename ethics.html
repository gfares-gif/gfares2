        <h1>IT Ethics</h1>
        <p>
            Ethics are essential in IT as technology impacts nearly every aspect of life. IT professionals must balance innovation with potential risks like privacy breaches, misinformation, and cyberbullying. They are responsible for designing technology with ethical considerations in mind, especially as advancements like AI and deepfakes often outpace regulations. Protecting personal data, preventing misuse, and addressing false information are critical, emphasizing the need for oversight to ensure technology benefits society.
